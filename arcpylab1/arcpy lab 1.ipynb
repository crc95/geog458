    "#### To create the geoJSON files for each county based on just the block data I changed methods a few times. I knew I had to iterate through both files to make sure that the county names are with the correct blocks, at first I created a new field in the saep_bg10 file but that kept taking too long to implement. I used a nested for loop to get all the blocks with a search cursor and an update cursor. When I changed course I made both search cursors and created the new shape files all at once by using an insert cursor. The part of the assignment was done in small steps that worked into the last step to make the code more complicated but being able to do it all at once."
