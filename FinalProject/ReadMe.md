Map 1: http://students.washington.edu/smitht24/nucleartestsites.html

Map 2: http://students.washington.edu/adc5/mortality.html

##### Story Map with Write-Up portion within.

We used the story map to break up the writing portion and have it flow within our narrative. We do the comparison of mapbox and storymap at the very end after the map conclusions.

This first map was created with data from Christina using a scraper, nominatim, shapely, lots of hours, then was produced in mapbox studio by Travis with great attention to detail and the hover feature added with javascript. The end result is something we are all proud of.

This map was created with a geojson file of fallout zone and a datafile of infant mortality rates by state by Alex.

Example of using esri story map to do a time series, Christina made a map with 3 time frames to show the yields of nuclear testing in Nevada.
